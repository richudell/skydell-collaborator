#P2P Messaging and Knowledge Base Platform#
This project is a peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging and communication platform with a built-in distributed knowledge base. It supports real-time communication via WebRTC and provides remote viewing (screen sharing) for peer support. The knowledge base is distributed using IPFS, ensuring decentralized and fail-safe access to information.

Features
Real-time Messaging: Peer-to-peer messaging using WebRTC.
Distributed Knowledge Base: IPFS-based distributed storage and retrieval of knowledge base articles.
Remote Viewing (Screen Sharing): Real-time screen sharing for peer support using WebRTC.
User Authentication: Public-private key pair identity management for secure communication.
Data Replication: Fault-tolerant replication of messages and articles across peers for fail-safe operations.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
P2P Messaging: WebRTC with WebSockets for signaling
Remote Viewing: WebRTC Screen Sharing via getDisplayMedia
Distributed Knowledge Base: IPFS (InterPlanetary File System)
Signaling Server: Node.js with WebSocket (Express.js)
Database: Firebase (optional for storing metadata)
Deployment: Heroku (for signaling server), Netlify (for frontend)
Installation
Prerequisites
Node.js (v14.x or higher)
npm or yarn
IPFS CLI (for local IPFS nodes) or use Infura.
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/p2p-messaging-knowledgebase.git
cd p2p-messaging-knowledgebase
Install Dependencies
Frontend (React app):
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm install
Backend (Signaling server):
bash
Copy code
cd ../signaling-server
npm install
Set Up Firebase (Optional)
If you plan to use Firebase for user metadata or authentication:

Create a Firebase project at Firebase Console.
Add Firebase configuration to frontend/src/firebase-config.js.
Running the Project
1. Start the Signaling Server (Backend)
The signaling server helps peers discover each other for WebRTC connections and screen sharing.

bash
Copy code
cd signaling-server
npm start
The signaling server will run on http://localhost:3001.

2. Start the Frontend (React App)
bash
Copy code
cd frontend
npm start
The frontend will be available on http://localhost:3000.

3. Run IPFS (Optional)
If you're running a local IPFS node:

bash
Copy code
ipfs daemon
Alternatively, configure the app to use Infura by adding your Infura project credentials to the frontend/src/ipfs-config.js.

Architecture
P2P Messaging
WebRTC: Handles peer-to-peer messaging and screen sharing with encrypted communication.
Signaling Server: Facilitates peer discovery and WebRTC handshakes via WebSockets.
Knowledge Base
IPFS: A decentralized file storage system for knowledge base articles. Articles are split into chunks and stored across multiple peers, ensuring replication and fault tolerance.
Data Replication
LocalStorage: Temporarily stores messages and knowledge base content on each peer.
IPFS: Ensures content is accessible even when a peer is offline, leveraging content-addressable storage for persistence.
Screen Sharing for Remote Peer Support
This platform allows users to share their screen with another peer for remote support or collaboration. The screen sharing feature is powered by WebRTC and is fully peer-to-peer, ensuring privacy and low latency.

How to Use Screen Sharing
Start Screen Sharing: In the chat interface, click the "Share Screen" button.
Select Screen: A prompt will appear to choose which screen or window to share.
Remote Viewing: The peer you are connected to will see your shared screen in real time.
Stop Sharing: You can stop screen sharing at any time by clicking "Stop Sharing."
All screen sharing data is transferred securely between peers without involving any centralized servers.

Screen Sharing Code Example
Capture and share the screen:

javascript
Copy code
const startScreenSharing = async () => {
    try {
        const screenStream = await navigator.mediaDevices.getDisplayMedia({
            video: true,
        });
        sendScreenStreamToPeer(screenStream);
    } catch (err) {
        console.error("Error sharing screen:", err);
    }
};
Display the shared screen on the receiving peer:

javascript
Copy code
peerConnection.ontrack = (event) => {
    const [remoteStream] = event.streams;
    document.getElementById('remoteVideo').srcObject = remoteStream;
};
Security
End-to-End Encryption: WebRTC uses DTLS to encrypt communication between peers, ensuring secure message exchange and screen sharing.
Public-Private Key Pairs: Each peer has a unique key pair for identity verification and secure communication.
SSL/TLS: All communication with the signaling server is encrypted using HTTPS.
